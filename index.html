      <h2>Pugsley's</h2>
      <p>While not technically on Arthur Ave, it's still a Fordham favorite. You haven't lived unless you've made your own pizza here or had Sal serenade you. Pugsley's pizza is great, but love is it.</p>

      <h2>Full Moon</h2>
      <p>Full Moon is a classic pizza spot on Arthur, feeding the Bronx community and Fordham students since 1976. Everyone has their favorite slice here, and although we miss Palombo's accross the street, Full Moon can hold it's own when it comes to delicious food.</p>

      <h2>John's</h2>
      <p>Great all-around pizza options can be found at John's, but their pizza menu does play home to two magic words: gluten free. If you need to satisfy a gluten free pizza lover, this is the place to go (while also enjoying a slice of your own of course).</p>

      <h2>University Pizza</h2>
      <p>You want to know what's better than pizza? Pizza with free delivery. University Pizza sits just accross from the Bathgate entrance to Fordham, so if you're craving a slice, are too lazy to leave the building, don't want to pay extra for delivery, and want that food quick, University Pizza is your best option.</p>

      <h2>Michaelangelo's</h2>
      <p>When parents come to visit, you want to show them the best of the Bronx's Little Italy, right? And if the parents are visiting, you're not the one paying, right? Perfect, sounds like you need to go to Michaelangelo's and pretend the food you eat when they're not there is always that good.</p>
